Translation Visulization:  
This is a project aims to dispaly the varieties of tokens between different translation versions.  
Our base text is English version of Shakespeare's Othello.  
And we also process 15 translation versions of Othello in German.  
There are 4 panels to display the tokens visualization:  
    Frequency Visualization: Display most frequent tokens in each text;  
    Tf-Idf Visualization: Display the Tf-Idf value, or say weight, of the tokens in each text;  
    Lemma & Frequency Visualization: Most frequent German lemmas in each text;  
    Lemma & Tf-Idf Visualizaton: weighting of German lemmas in each text;  
Features/ user option:  
    Switch different visualization panels;  
    Choose order of translation versions;  
    Turn on/off sigle version;  
    Turn on/off tokens in the canvass;  
    Zoom in/out panels;
