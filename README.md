Translation Visulization
This is a project aims to dispaly the varieties of tokens between different translation versions.
Our base text is English version of Shakespeare's Othello.
And we also process another 15 translation versions of Othello in German.
The main visualization is to display the top 50 frequent tokens in each version.
There are also lines to connect same tokens and its English text.
