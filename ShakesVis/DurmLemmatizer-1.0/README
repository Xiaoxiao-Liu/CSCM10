This is the Durm German Lemmatization System.

This distribution includes:

GATE components
===============
Components for use with the GATE system (http://gate.ac.uk/):

o CaseTagger: the German Case Tagger component
o Number: the German Number Tagger component
o GermanMorphologicalAnalyzer: the German Morphological Analyzer component
o GermanLemmatizer: the main Lemmatization component

All components are pre-compiled (note: Java1.5!), so you can use them directly
with your GATE installation without compiling them yourself.


Resources
=========
The following directories include the resources needed for running the system:

o CaseProbs: probability files for use with the CaseTagger
o DeLem: JAPE grammar file (to be used as a multi-phase transducer)
o DE-Lexicon: the automatically created German lexicon

Note: all text files are Unicode (UTF-8) encoded.
